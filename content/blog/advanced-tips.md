# Advanced Tips for Power Users

Once you're comfortable generating basic documents, try these techniques to level up your workflow.

1. **Use Custom Templates** – Upload your own LaTeX template and let the AI fill in the content sections.
2. **Automate Citations** – Provide a BibTeX file so the generator can automatically include your references.
3. **Fine-tune the Output** – Use the modify feature to adjust the AI-generated LaTeX without rewriting everything.
4. **Collaborate with Peers** – Share your document link in our [Community Forum](/community) to gather feedback.

For a refresher on the basics, read our [Getting Started guide](./getting-started.md).
